# Building Geospatial Web Components

[Preview presentation](https://driskull.github.io/2022-ds-building-geospatial-web-components)

To be presented at [Esri Developer Summit 2022](http://www.esri.com/events/devsummit).

Presenters: Dhrumil Shah, Ganesh Subbiah, Matt Driscoll

Thursday 10:30 a.m. — 11:30 a.m.

HYBRID SESSION | In this session, you will learn how Esri Web applications leverage the native web components to build re-usable, shareable, framework agnostic geospatial UI components. We will look at an example of how to build a geospatial web component using stencil.js. Also, we will look at how a monolithic geospatial web application like Map Viewer was transformed to a micro front-end leveraging web components.
